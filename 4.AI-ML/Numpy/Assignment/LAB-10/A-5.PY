# The bisection method is a technique for finding solutions (roots) to equations with a single 
# unknown  variable.  Given  a  polynomial  function  f,  try  to  find  an  initial  interval  off  by 
# random probe.  Store all the updates in an Numpy array. Plot the root finding process using 
# the matplotlib/pyplot library.

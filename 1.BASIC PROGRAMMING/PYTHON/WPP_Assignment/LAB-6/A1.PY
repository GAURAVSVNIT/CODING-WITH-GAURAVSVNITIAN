"""
Write a class called Password_manager. The class should have a list called old_passwords that
holds all of the user’s past passwords. The last item of the list is the user’s current pass word.
There should be a method called get_password that returns the current password and a method
called set_password that sets the user’s password. The set_password method should only
change the password if the attempted password is different from all the user’s past passwords.
Finally, create a method called is_correct that receives a string and returns a boolean True or
False depending on whether the string is equal to the current password or not.

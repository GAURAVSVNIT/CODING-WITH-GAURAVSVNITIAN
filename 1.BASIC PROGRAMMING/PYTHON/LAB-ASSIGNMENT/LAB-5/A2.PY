# chocolate bar exactly K times, what is the maximum number of chocolate pieces Alex can cut and 
# give Silvia? 
 
# Input Format: 
# The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. 
# Each line contains an integer K 
 
# Output Format: 
# T lines. Each line contains an integer that denotes the maximum number of pieces can be obtained 
# for each test case. 
 
# Constraints 
# 1 <= T <= 10 
# 2 <= K <= 107 
 
# Note: 
# Chocolate must be served in size of 1*1 size pieces. 
# Alex canâ€™t relocate any of the pieces, not can he place any piece on top of other.

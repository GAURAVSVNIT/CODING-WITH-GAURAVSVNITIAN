After accidentally leaving an ice chest of fish and shrimp in your car for a week while you
were on vacation, you're now in the market for a new vehicle. Your insurance didn't cover
the loss, so you want to make sure you get a good deal on your new car.
Given a Series of car asking_prices and another Series of car fair_prices, determine which
cars for sale are a good deal. In other words, identify cars whose asking price is less than
their fair price.
The result should be a list of integer indices corresponding to the good deals
in asking_prices.

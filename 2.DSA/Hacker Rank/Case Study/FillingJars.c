// Animesh	has	N	empty	candy	jars,	numbered	from	1	to	N,	with	infinite	capacity.	He	performs	M	operations.	Each	operation	is
//  described	by	3	integers	a,	b	and	k.	Here,	a	and	b	are	indices	of	the	jars,	and	k	is	the	number	of	candies	to	be	added	inside	each
//  jar	whose	index	lies	between	a	and	b	(both	inclusive).	Can	you	tell	the	average	number	of	candies	after	M	operations?
//  Input	Format	
// The	first	line	contains	two	integers	N	and	M	separated	by	a	single	space.	
// M	lines	follow.	Each	of	the	M	lines	contain	three	integers	a,	b	and	k	separated	by	single	space.
//  Output	Format	
// A	single	line	containing	the	average	number	of	candies	across	N	jars,	rounded	down	to	the	nearest	integer.
//  Note	
// Rounded	down	means	finding	the	greatest	integer	which	is	less	than	or	equal	to	given	number.	Eg,	13.65	and	13.23	is	rounded
//  down	to	13,	while	12.98	is	rounded	down	to	12
